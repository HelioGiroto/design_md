## Overview

Design with vintage analog film aesthetic. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. There's a reason the lo-fi hip hop girl never stopped studying. She became shorthand for a feeling — warmth in a cold digital landscape. The analog revival in design didn't start with nostalgia; it started with distrust. When everything on screen became too clean, too vector-perfect, designers reached backward. Film grain. VHS tracking lines. The soft blur of a cassette dub copied three times over. These artifacts weren't flaws anymore — they were proof of human touch.

The 2010s YouTube lo-fi explosion made it mainstream, but the roots go deeper. Graphic designers in the early 2000s were already scanning old Polaroids, layering halftone dots over digital layouts, trying to make pixels feel less sterile. Then AI-generated imagery arrived and the need intensified. When any machine can produce a flawless render, imperfection becomes the new authenticity. A slightly blown-out highlight, a color shift toward amber — these say "a person was here."

Today the aesthetic lives everywhere: album covers, indie brand packaging, editorial photography sites. It's not about faking the past. It's about borrowing its texture to make the present feel less disposable.

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.

- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Film grain visible
- Do Colors faded/warm
- Do Light leaks present
- Do Nostalgic feel achieved
