## Overview

Retro Windows — Windows 95 chrome: gray title bars, MS Sans Serif, pixel typography, full nostalgia. Press Start 2P typography. Windows 95 system palette: 3D-button gray, navy title bars, pixel-perfect inset/. Best for retro gaming pitch, Y2K brand, creator portfolio (90s aesthetic). AI-ready design system. Windows 95 wasn't just an operating system — it was the entire visual vocabulary of personal computing for a decade. That grey chrome, those beveled buttons, the inset borders that made every panel feel like a physical object you could press. Microsoft's design team built a UI language rooted in skeuomorphism before we had a word for it: raised surfaces caught light from the top-left, depressed areas fell into shadow at the bottom-right. It was consistent, learnable, and brutally systematic.

The aesthetic died slowly through XP's Fisher-Price curves and Vista's glass fetish, but it never fully disappeared from collective memory. Millennials who grew up dragging Solitaire cards and customizing Winamp skins carry this visual language in their bones. When developers put Windows 95 dialogs in their portfolio sites or indie games ship with pixel-perfect title bars, they're not just being ironic — they're tapping into a shared understanding of what "computer" looked like before everything went flat.

Today the style functions as both genuine nostalgia and deliberate anti-design statement. It says: we remember when interfaces had texture, weight, and a 16-color palette that somehow felt like enough.
