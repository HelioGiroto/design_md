## Overview

Broadside — Dark editorial canvas with a single fire orange accent and bilingual Latin/Chinese type stack. Barlow typography. near-black newspaper canvas with warm cream text and a single fire-orange headli. Best for brand manifesto, founder vision deck, magazine / cultural pitch. AI-ready design system. The broadside is the oldest form of mass communication design. Before newspapers existed as we know them, single-sheet broadsides were plastered across city walls — urgent, loud, impossible to ignore. They announced executions, political upheaval, and market prices with equal typographic fury. Everything was hierarchy: massive wood-type headlines dominating the sheet, body text crammed below in tight columns.

What made broadsides work wasn't subtlety. It was the raw collision of scale. A 72-point headline next to 8-point body copy creates tension that still feels electric. The near-black ink on cheap paper, occasionally punctuated by a single spot color for emphasis — that's where the fire orange enters. Not decorative. Functional. A visual alarm bell.

Modern editorial design owes everything to this lineage. The broadside taught us that typography IS the interface. No imagery needed. No illustration required. Just letterforms doing violent, beautiful work at extreme scales.
