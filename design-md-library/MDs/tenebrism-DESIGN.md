## Overview

Tenebrism-inspired landing page with extreme contrast between light and deep darkness. Ideal for pôsteres atmosféricos, flyers de eventos, spreads editoriais, embalagens premium. AI-ready template. Tenebrism isn't just chiaroscuro turned up to eleven — it's a philosophical stance disguised as a lighting technique. When Caravaggio started plunging his backgrounds into absolute blackness around 1600, he wasn't being dramatic for drama's sake. He was rejecting the idealized, evenly-lit world of Mannerism and forcing viewers to confront raw, unfiltered humanity emerging from void. The light in tenebrism doesn't illuminate a scene — it interrogates it.

The technique spread like wildfire through the Caravaggisti — Artemisia Gentileschi, Georges de La Tour, Jusepe de Ribera — each understanding that darkness isn't absence, it's presence. De La Tour's candlelit scenes prove you can build entire emotional architectures with a single light source and the courage to let everything else disappear. This wasn't subtlety. This was conviction.

What makes tenebrism endure in design is its brutal editorial clarity. It forces hierarchy. When 80% of your canvas is black, whatever catches light becomes undeniable. There's no hiding behind busy compositions or safe middle-gray compromises. You commit to the darkness, or you don't. Half-measures produce mud.
