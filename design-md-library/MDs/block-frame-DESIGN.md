## Overview

BlockFrame — Neobrutalist deck with pastel-neon color blocks and chunky black borders. Space Grotesk typography. off-white background with neon pastel blocks (hot pink, sky blue, lime green, go. Best for creative agency pitch, indie SaaS launch, designer portfolio. AI-ready design system. Brutalism in graphic design was never meant to be pretty — it was a rejection of the polished, the corporate, the safe. When it migrated to the web in the mid-2010s, it carried that same defiance: raw HTML energy, system fonts, borders that screamed rather than whispered. But something interesting happened around 2020. Designers started softening the edges — literally. Pastel backgrounds crept in. Neon accents replaced monochrome severity. The chunky borders stayed, but they became playful rather than aggressive. Neobrutalism was born from this tension.

BlockFrame sits squarely in this lineage. It takes the structural honesty of brutalism — visible borders, flat surfaces, no pretense of depth — and wraps it in candy colors. The hard drop shadows aren't decorative; they're architectural. They tell you exactly where one element ends and another begins. There's no blur, no gradient trying to fake materiality. Every pixel knows its place.

What makes this approach endure is its legibility. In an era of glassmorphism and blurred overlays competing for attention, neobrutalism cuts through by being unapologetically flat and loud. It's the design equivalent of speaking in a clear voice instead of whispering through frosted glass.
