## Overview

Neo-Grid Bold — Editorial neo-brutalism with a single neon yellow accent on off-white paper. Space Grotesk typography. off-white paper background, ink black, signature neon yellow accent used sparing. Best for product launch, design review, founder pitch. AI-ready design system. Neo-brutalism didn't emerge from nowhere — it's the rebellious grandchild of Swiss modernism filtered through 90s rave flyers and early-web geocities chaos. When designers got tired of the same rounded-corner, soft-shadow SaaS aesthetic dominating every landing page from 2016 onward, they reached back to Brutalist architecture's raw concrete honesty and slammed it into digital interfaces. The movement gained real traction around 2019-2021 when studios like Locomotive and agencies tired of "clean" started shipping work with hard edges, visible grids, and colors that hurt.

Neo-Grid Bold takes this lineage and pushes the structural obsession further. Where early neo-brutalism was often chaotic — overlapping elements, broken layouts — this approach imposes a rigid, thick-bordered grid system that contains the energy without killing it. Bebas Neue isn't decorative here; it's architectural. Each letterform becomes a structural column. The neon yellow isn't accent — it's load-bearing. You're looking at punk rock that learned drafting.
