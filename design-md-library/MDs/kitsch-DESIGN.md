## Overview

Kitsch landing page with intentionally bright, exaggerated, over-the-top aesthetics. Ideal for branding satírico, produtos de novidade, autocolantes, campanhas de marketing exageradas. AI-ready template. Kitsch never asked for permission. It crawled out of post-war consumer culture — cheap souvenirs, velvet paintings, plastic flamingos — everything the art establishment despised. The term itself carried German disdain for sentimental trash, but that's exactly what gave it power. By the time Susan Sontag wrote 'Notes on Camp' in 1964, the conversation shifted: what if bad taste, deployed with full awareness, becomes its own aesthetic statement? Suddenly the line between sincere and ironic collapsed entirely.

The 1980s and 90s turned kitsch into a design weapon. Jeff Koons put balloon dogs in galleries. John Waters built an entire filmography on it. Memphis Group furniture made modernists physically uncomfortable. These weren't accidents — they were deliberate provocations against good taste as a gatekeeping mechanism. Kitsch said: your hierarchies are boring, and we're going to make something louder, cheaper-looking, and more memorable than anything in your approved canon.

Today kitsch lives in brand identities that refuse subtlety, in maximalist web design that treats whitespace as cowardice, in the entire aesthetic vocabulary of internet irony. It's not retro nostalgia — it's an active rejection of the idea that restraint equals sophistication.
