## Overview

Steampunk landing page fusing Victorian elegance with steam-powered mechanical aesthetics. Ideal for capas de livros de fantasia, merchandise temático, gráficos de videojogos, eventos cosplay. AI-ready template. Steampunk didn't emerge from a design studio — it crawled out of speculative fiction in the 1980s, when writers like K.W. Jeter and William Gibson started asking what would happen if the Victorian era never ended. The aesthetic crystallized around a simple premise: what if computation ran on steam and brass instead of silicon? That question unlocked an entire visual language — exposed gears, riveted copper panels, analog gauges, leather straps, and the ornamental excess of Industrial Revolution machinery.

What makes Steampunk endure as a design system isn't nostalgia — it's the tension between mechanical honesty and decorative extravagance. Victorian engineering celebrated visible function: you could see how a clock worked, trace the logic of a locomotive's pistons. Steampunk borrows that transparency and pushes it into fantasy. Every gear is both structural and ornamental. Every rivet is both fastener and decoration.

The movement gained mainstream traction through gaming, cosplay, and maker culture in the 2000s. It proved that audiences crave interfaces and environments where the mechanics are legible — where the system shows its work rather than hiding behind flat minimalism.

- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Gear/cog SVG decorations
