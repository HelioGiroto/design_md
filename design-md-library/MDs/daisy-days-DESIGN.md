## Overview

Daisy Days — Cheerful pastel deck with hand-drawn daisies, stars, and rainbows. Friendly, soft, and warm. Fredoka One typography. warm cream base with a full pastel rainbow (mint, lavender, peach, sky, soft pin. Best for education / classroom, kids product launch, wellness program. AI-ready design system. Hand-drawn florals have anchored children's visual culture since the Arts and Crafts movement rejected industrial sterility in favor of organic, imperfect linework. The daisy — simple enough for a child to draw, universal enough to transcend language — became shorthand for innocence across decades of picture books, nursery textiles, and educational materials.

The pastel rainbow palette here isn't arbitrary nostalgia. It descends directly from the soft chromatic ranges popularized by Japanese kawaii culture in the 1970s and later absorbed into Western children's branding through Sanrio's global expansion. That specific intersection — Western botanical illustration meets Eastern color sensibility — created the visual language we now instinctively read as 'gentle, playful, safe.'

Fredoka One anchors the typography with rounded terminals that echo the petal shapes themselves. It's a deliberate rejection of the geometric sans-serifs that dominated children's branding in the 2010s. The font says: we're not trying to look modern, we're trying to feel warm. That distinction matters when you're designing for audiences who process emotion before information.
