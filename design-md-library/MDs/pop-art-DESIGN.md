## Overview

Pop Art landing page with extremely saturated bold colors and comic-strip aesthetics. Ideal for branding lúdico, design de vestuário, embalagens icônicas, capas editoriais. AI-ready template. Pop Art didn't ask permission. It kicked down the gallery door in the late 1950s and dragged commercial culture — soup cans, comic strips, celebrity headshots — into spaces that had been reserved for oil-on-canvas reverence. Warhol understood repetition as critique; Lichtenstein turned Ben-Day dots into a weapon against artistic pretension. The movement was a direct rejection of Abstract Expressionism's navel-gazing — suddenly art could be loud, accessible, and mass-produced without apology.

What makes Pop Art endure in design isn't nostalgia — it's the underlying philosophy. These artists treated visual culture as raw material. They flattened hierarchy between high and low, proving that a Brillo box could carry the same weight as a Rothko. That democratization of imagery is essentially what every brand designer does today when they pull from memes, street culture, or TikTok aesthetics.

The palette was never subtle. Saturated magentas, electric yellows, cyan pushed to the edge — colors chosen for maximum retinal impact, borrowed directly from commercial printing limitations that became deliberate stylistic choices.
