## Overview

Steampunk space landing page, nebula background, brass and copper gears, vintage sci-fi aesthetic, explorer style, cosmic industrial. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Before NASA, before radio telescopes and satellite arrays, there were people in wool coats squinting through brass tubes at infinity. Victorian astronomers mapped the cosmos with hand-ground lenses and obsessive patience — their observatories were temples of gears, copper fittings, and hand-drawn star charts inked on vellum. That tension between the impossibly vast and the painstakingly handmade is where steampunk-meets-space lives.

The aesthetic pulls from a real moment in history: the 1800s, when nebulae were first sketched (not photographed) by people who had no idea what they were actually looking at. Lord Rosse built a 72-inch telescope — a monster of riveted iron and speculum metal — just to peer at the Whirlpool Galaxy. The drawings that came out of those sessions look like fever dreams. Swirling, organic, deeply human interpretations of cosmic structure.

Steampunk Nebula Explorer channels that energy. Mechanical precision meeting cosmic chaos. Brass against the void. It's not retro-futurism for nostalgia's sake — it's a reminder that wonder and craft used to be the same thing.

- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Deep blue/space background
- Do Brass/Copper metallic accents
- Do Gear/Machine visuals
- Do Vintage display typography
- Do Glowing nebula effects
