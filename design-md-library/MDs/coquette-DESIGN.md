## Overview

Coquette landing page with soft romantic pastels and delicate feminine aesthetics. Ideal for branding de boutiques, editoriais femininos, embalagens de beleza e moda, convites. AI-ready template. Coquette didn't emerge from nowhere — it's the logical endpoint of a decade-long pendulum swing away from minimalism. After years of flat design, neutral palettes, and "clean" everything, designers (and teenagers on TikTok) collectively decided that ornament isn't crime. The 2022-2024 coquette explosion on social media repackaged Rococo excess through a digital-native lens: satin bows as UI elements, lace textures as backgrounds, blush pink as a personality trait.

What makes coquette interesting as a design movement — beyond the obvious femininity — is the tension it holds between irony and sincerity. Early adopters used it with a wink. The bow was camp. But as the aesthetic matured, something shifted. Designers started using these elements earnestly, stripping away the quotation marks. A ribbon isn't referencing femininity anymore; it IS the femininity. That earnestness is what separates coquette from previous retro revivals.

The movement also forced a reckoning with gendered design. For years, "feminine" was treated as lesser in design discourse — decorative meant unserious. Coquette flipped that hierarchy deliberately, making softness a power move rather than an apology.
