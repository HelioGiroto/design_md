## Overview

Whiteboard-style landing page that looks like a collaborative brainstorming session. Ideal for brainstorming, education, ferramentas colaborativas, startups, apresentações. AI-ready template. The whiteboard is one of those objects that feels like it's always existed, but it really only took over from the chalkboard in the late 1960s. Martin Heit, a Korean War veteran turned photographer, is often credited with commercializing the first melamine dry-erase surface. By the 1990s, whiteboards had colonized every conference room, classroom, and design studio on the planet — not because they were technologically impressive, but because they removed friction. No dust, no permanence, no commitment. You sketch, you erase, you sketch again.

What makes the whiteboard genuinely interesting from a design perspective is how it changed collaborative thinking. Before whiteboards, shared ideation meant passing paper around or talking at each other. The whiteboard gave groups a shared canvas with zero preciousness — the impermanence is the feature. It told people: this isn't final, this is thinking out loud. That psychological permission changed how teams work together.

The marker itself deserves credit too. The chisel tip that lets you switch between thick strokes and fine lines with a wrist rotation — that's a masterclass in tool versatility. Four colors became the universal constraint that somehow never feels limiting.

- Density: 3/10 — Airy
- Variance: 8/10 — Expressive
- Motion: 8/10 — Cinematic

## Colors

- **Board White** (#FEFEFE) — Light surface, card backgrounds
- **Marker Black** (#2C2C2C) — Dark surface, primary background
- **Marker Blue** (#1565C0) — Accent highlight, links and focus states
- **Marker Red** (#D32F2F) — Error states, destructive actions
- **Marker Green** (#388E3C) — Success states, positive indicators
- **Marker Orange** (#F57C00) — Warm accent, call-to-action secondary
- **Highlight Yellow** (#FFF9C4) — Warning states, attention indicators


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** Architects Daughter — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Accent:** Patrick Hand — Used for decorative or emphasis text
- **Body:** Architects Daughter — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** Architects Daughter — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Asymmetric composition.
- **Feature sections:** Asymmetric grid with varied card sizes. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Hand-drawn style borders (slightly irregular via SVG filter), marker-weight typography (variable stroke), subtle grid/dot pattern background, sticky note elements with slight rotation (1-3deg), connector lines between sections, whiteboard shadow on edges

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Clean white background with dot grid
- Do Marker-style colored typography
- Do Sticky note elements with rotation
- Do Hand-drawn style borders
- Do Connector lines between sections
- Do Sketch-style SVG icons


## Use Case

Brainstorming, Education, Collaborative tools, Startups, Presentations
