## Overview

Cozy and rustic hand-drawn landing page for an artisanal coffee shop and bakery. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Third-wave coffee didn't just change how we drink — it rewired how we expect small businesses to look online. Before 2010, most café websites were clip-art disasters or over-templated WordPress themes. Then came the pour-over revolution, and with it, a visual language borrowed from letterpress printing, kraft paper packaging, and the deliberate imperfection of hand-drawn type. Suddenly every roaster needed a site that felt like their shop smelled.

The aesthetic crystallized around warmth. Muted earth tones, textured backgrounds that mimicked recycled stock, illustrations that looked sketched on a napkin during a slow morning shift. Photography went moody — steam rising, flour-dusted hands, latte art captured mid-pour. The digital experience had to feel analog. Cozy. Like you could almost hear the grinder.

What's interesting is how this language scaled beyond coffee into bakeries, artisan food shops, and neighborhood businesses that trade on craft and proximity. The visual vocabulary says: we made this by hand, we care about the details, come sit down for a while.
