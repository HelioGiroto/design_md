## Overview

Career resume landing page in Oregon Trail retro game style. Ideal for currículos criativos, portfólios de desenvolvedores, páginas pessoais, apresentações de carreira. AI-ready template. Oregon Trail isn't just a game — it's a shared cultural memory for an entire generation of computer users. Released in 1971 and popularized through school computer labs in the 80s and 90s, it became the first video game most Americans ever played. The green-and-black pixel art, the brutal decision-making, the infamous dysentery — these aren't just nostalgia triggers, they're a universal language.

What makes the Oregon Trail metaphor work so well for resumes and portfolios is that it reframes a career as a journey with real stakes. You forded rivers (pivoted careers), lost oxen (failed projects), and somehow made it to Oregon (landed the role). The trail format gives narrative structure to what's usually a flat, lifeless document. It turns a list of jobs into a story of survival and progress.

Gamers-turned-developers immediately get it. Recruiters who grew up with it get it too. That's rare overlap, and it's worth exploiting.
