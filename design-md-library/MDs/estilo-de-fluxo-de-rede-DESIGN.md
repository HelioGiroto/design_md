## Overview

Robust and connected landing page for network solutions. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. The visual language of networks didn't emerge from design studios. It came from whiteboards in server rooms. Engineers at Cisco were drawing topology maps in the early 90s — boxes connected by lines, nothing fancy — and that crude vocabulary stuck. When AWS launched its architecture icons in 2017, they essentially formalized what every infrastructure team was already sketching: nodes, edges, regions drawn as rounded rectangles. Cloudflare took a different route, leaning into the flow metaphor — data as particles traveling through a global mesh. Their marketing made infrastructure feel alive, kinetic.

What's interesting is how node-edge diagrams became the universal shorthand for distributed systems. Nobody decided this. It just happened because the mental model maps perfectly: services are nodes, connections are edges, and failure is a missing line. The style evolved from purely functional documentation into a full aesthetic category. Today you see it everywhere — landing pages for observability tools, pitch decks for cloud startups, even developer portfolios. The diagram became the brand.

The futuristic layer came later. Dark backgrounds, glowing connections, pulsing animations. That's the data center romanticism — making racks and cables feel like science fiction. It works because infrastructure is invisible by nature, and this style makes it tangible.

- **Era:** 2026+ Conectividade Ubíqua
- **Light/Dark:** ✓ Full / ✗ No

## Colors

- **Azul Conectividade** (#005691) — Accent highlight, links and focus states
- **Cinza Escuro** (#333333) — Dark surface, primary background
- **Branco** (#FFFFFF) — Light surface, card backgrounds
- **Cinza Claro** (#CCCCCC) — Secondary text, borders, muted elements
- **Verde Elétrico** (#00FF00) — Success states, positive indicators
- **Laranja** (#FFA500) — Warm accent, call-to-action secondary
- **Ciano** (#00FFFF) — Extended palette, decorative use
- **Preto** (#000000) — Deep contrast surface


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** Open Sans — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** Open Sans — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** Open Sans — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Visualização de fluxo de dados, diagramas de rede interativos, brilhos sutis em conexões, tipografia robusta, micro-interações de status, elementos modulares, animações de tráfego de rede.

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos
