## Overview

Grove — Forest-green canvas with cream type, classical Playfair serifs, and a single rust accent. Playfair Display typography. deep forest green canvas with warm bone type and a single rust-red accent. Best for sustainability brand, wellness brand, outdoor / nature product. AI-ready design system. The pairing of deep greens with earthy rust tones isn't a trend — it's a return to something older than graphic design itself. William Morris built an entire movement around it in the 1870s, rejecting industrial aesthetics in favor of natural pigments and botanical forms. The Arts & Crafts palette was never about decoration; it was ideological. Green meant growth, craft, resistance to the machine.

Playfair Display carries that same tension between refinement and groundedness. Its high contrast and sharp serifs feel editorial, almost aristocratic, but paired with forest green it reads as something rooted rather than precious. The rust accent does the heavy lifting here — it stops the palette from feeling too pristine, too "wellness brand circa 2019." Rust is the color of iron oxidizing, of leaves turning, of things that have been outside long enough to earn their texture.

This combination works because it doesn't try to aestheticize nature — it references the actual material reality of organic things. Soil, bark, lichen, patina. Designers who reach for mint and sage are decorating. Grove is documenting.
