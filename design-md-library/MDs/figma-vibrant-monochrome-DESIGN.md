## Overview

Figma-inspired landing page with strictly black-and-white interface chrome. Ideal for ferramentas de design, plataformas criativas, editores visuais, portfolios de design. AI-ready template. Before Figma showed up, design tools looked like design tools — meaning they looked boring. Sketch had its diamond icon on a yellow background, Adobe was stuck in its dark-UI-with-colored-splashes era, and InVision was doing that safe startup gradient thing everyone did in 2016. Figma broke the pattern by committing to something genuinely weird: electric, almost aggressive gradients floating on stark monochrome surfaces. The early brand (around 2016-2017) was restrained, but by the time Config became a thing, they'd fully embraced this tension between black/white structural clarity and these molten, almost liquid color moments.

What made it stick wasn't just the palette — it was the confidence. The gradients weren't decorative; they were the entire personality layer. Everything structural (type, layout, UI chrome) stayed monochrome and Swiss-grid disciplined, while color existed only as energy, as punctuation. This created a visual language that said 'serious tool, creative soul' without ever feeling like it was trying too hard.

The influence was immediate. Suddenly every dev tool, every collaborative platform, every startup with 'for teams' in its tagline was doing vibrant-on-monochrome. Linear, Raycast, Arc — they all owe something to Figma proving you could look both professional and alive. The gradient-as-brand-accent became the default aesthetic for an entire generation of tools.

- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
