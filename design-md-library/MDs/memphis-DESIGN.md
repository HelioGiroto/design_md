## Overview

Memphis-style landing page with vibrant bold colors, geometric shapes (triangles, circles, squiggles), postmodern 80s aesthetic. Ideal for branding retro, peças editoriais, embalagens funky, campanhas jovens. AI-ready template. Memphis exploded out of Milan in 1981 when Ettore Sottsass gathered a crew of designers who were collectively sick of the beige rationalism that dominated everything. They named the group after a Bob Dylan track playing during their first meeting — "Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again" — and proceeded to violate every rule modernism held sacred. Clashing colors, plastic laminates, terrazzo patterns, and shapes that served no functional purpose whatsoever. The establishment hated it. That was the point.

What Memphis understood, and what most design movements miss entirely, is that taste is political. By rejecting "good taste" as defined by the Bauhaus lineage, they exposed how much of modernist design was really about class signaling dressed up as universal truth. The squiggles and triangles weren't random — they were deliberate provocations against a design orthodoxy that had calcified into dogma.

The movement burned hot and brief. By 1988 Sottsass dissolved the group, but the DNA persists everywhere — from 90s Nickelodeon to contemporary brand identities that refuse to take themselves seriously. Every time a designer reaches for a zigzag or an arbitrary geometric accent, they're channeling Memphis whether they know it or not.
