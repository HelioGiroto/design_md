## Overview

Passport style landing page, travel document aesthetic, ink stamps, visa stickers, paper texture, official look, travel theme. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Passport aesthetics in digital design trace back to the early skeuomorphic era — when iOS apps literally rendered leather-bound booklets and stamped pages. Cheesy? Sometimes. But the impulse was right. Travel documents carry an emotional weight that few other paper artifacts match. The worn edges, the ink stamps from foreign ports, the perforated boarding pass torn at the gate — these textures signal adventure before a single word is read.

The stamp collection pattern deserves its own mention. Gamification borrowed it early: unlock a city, earn a stamp. Foursquare did it. Airline loyalty apps still do. It works because it mirrors a real behavior — flipping through passport pages and remembering where you've been. The metaphor doesn't need explanation. That's rare in UI.

Boarding pass layouts, meanwhile, gave designers a gift: a rigid information hierarchy baked into a familiar form. Departure. Arrival. Gate. Seat. The constraint is the feature. You don't fight the format — you lean into it, and users parse it instantly because they've held the real thing a hundred times.
