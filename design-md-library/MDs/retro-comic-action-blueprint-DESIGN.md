## Overview

Retro comic landing page, superhero style, pop art, halftone dots, speech bubbles, bold black outlines, bright primary colors. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. The retro-comic action blueprint draws from a lineage that most designers reference but few truly understand. It starts with Jack Kirby's explosive page compositions in the 1960s — those crackling energy fields, the forced perspective, the unapologetic dynamism that made static pages feel like they'd punch through the paper. Kirby didn't do subtlety. Neither does this system.

But the real DNA here isn't just Golden or Silver Age comics. It's the collision point: Ben-Day dots meeting screenprint aesthetics, Lichtenstein's pop art appropriation feeding back into the source material it stole from. By the 1980s, comics themselves had absorbed their own parody. Bold outlines got bolder. Colors went flatter. Action lines multiplied. The visual language became self-aware without losing its punch.

What makes this blueprint distinct from generic "comic book" theming is the structural rigor underneath the chaos. Every splash of halftone, every speed line, every knockout type treatment follows compositional rules borrowed from propaganda posters and pulp covers — media designed to grab attention at newsstand distance. That's not decoration. That's information hierarchy weaponized.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Bright Yellow/Red/Blue palette
- Do Thick black borders/outlines
- Do Halftone (dots) textures
- Do Comic book fonts
- Do Speech bubble containers
