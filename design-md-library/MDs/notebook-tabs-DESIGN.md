## Overview

Design an editorial, organized landing page that looks like a notebook. Ideal for blogs editoriais, digital magazines, portfolios criativos, educational platforms. AI-ready template. Notebook tabs didn't emerge from software. They're a direct lift from physical filing systems — those plastic dividers with printed labels that let you thumb through a binder without reading every page. The metaphor worked because everyone already understood it. Early HyperCard stacks and Apple's Newton used tab-like navigation to organize cards of information, treating each section as a discrete page you could flip to.

What's interesting is how the pattern diverged once it hit digital. Browser tabs became about parallel contexts — multiple documents open simultaneously. But notebook tabs kept the original promise: sequential organization within a single document or workspace. They're closer to a table of contents made interactive. Notion, Obsidian, and Bear all use variations of this pattern, though they rarely call them "tabs" anymore. The language shifted to "pages" or "sections," but the interaction model — click a labeled edge to reveal its content — remains unchanged from those plastic binder dividers.

The best implementations preserve that physicality. A slight overlap, a shadow suggesting depth, a sense that content exists behind the active surface rather than being conjured on demand.
