## Overview

Luxury and elegant interface with strict 60/30/10 color hierarchy. Ideal for branding de luxo, hotéis e hospitalidade premium, moda high-end, joalheria, serviços financeiros exclusivos. AI-ready template. Luxury design didn't emerge from aesthetics alone — it came from scarcity. The earliest luxury visual languages were born in Parisian couture houses and Swiss watchmaking, where every typographic choice signaled exclusivity. Didone serifs, generous whitespace, and restrained color palettes weren't decorative decisions; they were gatekeeping mechanisms. If your materials looked accessible, you weren't luxury.

The digital era nearly destroyed this. Early web design democratized everything, and luxury brands struggled to translate physical restraint into pixels. It took until the late 2010s for digital luxury to find its footing — brands like Bottega Veneta deleting social media entirely, Celine dropping its accent, entire websites reduced to a single typeface and negative space. The lesson was clear: luxury online means refusing to compete for attention.

Today's luxury design systems inherit this lineage but face new tensions. Dark modes, motion design, and immersive experiences push against the traditional stillness of luxury. The best work resolves this by treating motion as choreography rather than animation — deliberate, unhurried, almost reluctant to reveal itself.
