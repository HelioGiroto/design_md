## Overview

60s psychedelic landing page. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. The San Francisco concert poster scene of 1965–1971 wasn't just graphic design — it was visual rebellion. Wes Wilson's hand-lettered Fillmore posters bent typography until letters became organisms, pulsing and breathing against saturated backgrounds. Victor Moscoso, trained at Yale under Josef Albers, weaponized color theory by pairing vibrating complementary hues that made your eyes physically struggle to focus. That was the point. The discomfort was the message.

These artists worked under absurd constraints — one-color separations, cheap newsprint, tight deadlines from Bill Graham's office — and still produced work that redefined what a poster could do. The lettering wasn't meant to be read quickly. The colors weren't meant to be comfortable. Everything fought against the clean Swiss modernism that dominated commercial design.

Translating this energy to digital interfaces means understanding what made it dangerous in the first place: sensory overload as intentional communication. Modern screens handle vibrating color pairs beautifully. CSS gradients can swirl. Variable fonts can undulate. The toolkit is better now — the question is whether you have the nerve to actually push it.

- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Swirling patterns, liquid light show effects, distorted typography, vibrant color clashes, abstract illustrations, mind-bending animations, paisley patterns, free-form layouts

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Swirling patterns
- Do Liquid light show effects
- Do Distorted typography
- Do Vibrant color clashes
- Do Abstract illustrations
- Do Mind-bending animations
