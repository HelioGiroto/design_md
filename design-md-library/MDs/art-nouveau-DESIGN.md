## Overview

Design an Art Nouveau landing page with flowing organic lines and nature-inspired motifs. Ideal for design de pôsteres, capas de livros, branding orgânico e romântico, ilustração editorial. AI-ready template. Art Nouveau didn't just decorate surfaces — it fundamentally rejected the machine. Born in the 1890s across Brussels, Paris, and Vienna, the movement was a full-throated rebellion against industrial standardization. Architects like Horta and Guimard bent iron into whiplash curves. Mucha turned commercial posters into sacred geometry. The entire philosophy insisted that art belonged everywhere: door handles, metro entrances, perfume bottles. Nothing was too mundane to deserve beauty.

What makes Art Nouveau endure isn't nostalgia — it's the underlying logic. Every curve follows botanical growth patterns. Every ornament serves a structural or compositional purpose. The movement understood something we keep rediscovering: nature's forms aren't decorative afterthoughts, they're engineering solutions. When you trace a Guimard railing or a Tiffany lamp, you're following the same mathematical progressions found in fern fronds and nautilus shells.

The movement collapsed by 1910, crushed under its own production costs and the rising appetite for geometric simplicity. But its DNA persists in every brand that chooses organic flow over rigid grids — every time a designer reaches for a tendril instead of a straight line.
