## Overview

Chalkboard landing page, blackboard background, hand drawn chalk style, white sketch on dark, educational aesthetic, doodle icons. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. The chalkboard never really left us. It retreated from classrooms into nostalgia, then resurfaced in digital interfaces as something more deliberate — a conscious rejection of sterile perfection. When educators and designers started placing hand-drawn letterforms and wobbly diagrams against dark, textured backgrounds, they weren't being retro. They were solving a problem: how do you make a screen feel like a conversation instead of a broadcast?

There's a reason the best lecturers always preferred chalk to slides. The act of drawing in real-time — imperfect, sequential, human — creates cognitive intimacy. Digital chalkboard aesthetics inherit this. The dark ground reduces eye strain during long sessions while the sketch-note elements signal "this is being built with you, not presented at you." It's participatory by implication.

What makes this aesthetic endure where others fade is its honesty. A hand-drawn arrow can't lie about hierarchy the way a gradient can. Sketch-notes on dark backgrounds carry the weight of someone thinking out loud — and that vulnerability is exactly what learning environments need.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure white (#FFFFFF) backgrounds — use off-white or dark surfaces
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Dark green/grey blackboard texture
- Do White 'chalk' text and lines
- Do Hand-drawn diagrams/arrows
- Do Wood border/frame elements
- Do Dusty texture overlay
