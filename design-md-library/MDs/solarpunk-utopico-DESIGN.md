## Overview

Solarpunk utopian landing page. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Solarpunk emerged in the early 2010s as a deliberate rejection of dystopia. Where cyberpunk gave us rain-soaked neon and corporate decay, solarpunk asked: what if we actually got it right? The aesthetic draws from Art Nouveau's organic curves, pairs them with photovoltaic glass and vertical gardens, and wraps everything in a palette that feels like morning light through leaves. It's speculative design with genuine hope baked in.

The visual language is unmistakable — translucent solar panels as architectural ornament, mycelium networks rendered as data flows, cities where infrastructure and ecology aren't fighting each other. Think Gaudi meets greenhouse. The movement borrows heavily from indigenous futurism and solves the problem most tech aesthetics ignore: how do you make sustainability look desirable rather than sacrificial?

Green tech companies caught on fast. Tesla's early marketing flirted with it. Newer climate startups lean in hard — using those warm ambers, deep botanical greens, and flowing geometries to signal that their product isn't just less bad, it's actively beautiful. The aesthetic does real work: it makes the future feel like somewhere you'd want to live.

- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 20px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Organic vine borders
