## Overview

Ukiyo-e landing page, woodblock print style, japanese art, bold outlines, prussian blue, paper texture, traditional graphic design. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Hokusai didn't care about realism. Neither did Hiroshige. What they cared about was essence — distilling a mountain, a wave, a bridge in rain down to its most potent visual form. Flat planes of color. Decisive outlines. Zero apology.

This is why ukiyo-e translates so cleanly to screens. The woodblock process itself enforced constraints that digital designers chase voluntarily: limited color palettes, hard edges, no gradients to hide behind. Every shape had to earn its place on the block. The Great Wave isn't just an art history footnote — it's a masterclass in visual hierarchy that still outperforms most modern compositions. One focal point. Layered depth through overlap, not shadow. Color doing structural work.

When Art Nouveau hit Europe, it was ukiyo-e they were stealing from. When flat design emerged in 2012, it was rediscovering principles that Edo-period printmakers solved centuries earlier. The revival isn't nostalgia. It's recognition that these constraints produce clarity — and clarity is what interfaces desperately need.
