## Overview

Design an artistic and experimental brutalist landing page for a digital artist portfolio. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Abstract brutalism on the web didn't emerge from design systems or agency trend reports. It came from artists who looked at the browser and saw a canvas that everyone else was trying to tame. Around 2014–2016, a loose network of digital artists—many adjacent to net art collectives and experimental type foundries—started treating the webpage itself as the artwork. No separation between container and content. The gallery became the interface became the piece.

What makes this strain distinct from functional brutalism is intent. These weren't developers rejecting CSS frameworks out of pragmatism. These were artists deliberately exploiting the raw materiality of HTML and CSS—overflow as composition, z-index as depth, system fonts as texture. The browser's default rendering wasn't a limitation to overcome but a palette to manipulate. Olia Lialina's work, Rafaël Rozendaal's single-serving sites, the entire arena.are.na ecosystem—all ancestors of this thinking.

The gallery-as-interface concept flipped the portfolio convention entirely. Instead of neutral white walls showcasing work, the portfolio structure itself communicates artistic position. Navigation becomes gesture. Layout becomes statement. The website doesn't house the art—it is the art.

- Density: 5/10 — Balanced
- Variance: 8/10 — Expressive
- Motion: 4/10 — Subtle

- **Style:** Artistic, Experimental, Unconventional
- **Keywords:** digital art, experimental, portfolio, abstract, unconventional, raw, bold, artistic, disruptive, unique
- **Era:** 2026+ Arte Digital Pós-Moderna
- **Light/Dark:** ✓ Full / ✗ No

## Colors

- **Cinza Concreto** (#A9A9A9) — Secondary text, borders, muted elements
- **Preto** (#000000) — Dark surface, primary background
- **Vermelho Sangue** (#8B0000) — Error states, destructive actions
- **Branco** (#FFFFFF) — Light surface, card backgrounds
- **Azul Cobalto** (#0047AB) — Secondary accent
- **Amarelo Ocre** (#CC7722) — Warning states, attention indicators
- **Verde Musgo** (#6B8E23) — Success states, positive indicators
- **Laranja Queimado** (#CC5500) — Warm accent, call-to-action secondary


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** Arial Black — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** Arial Black — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** Arial Black — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Asymmetric composition.
- **Feature sections:** Asymmetric grid with varied card sizes. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Texturas de concreto e metal, tipografia áspera e desalinhada, imagens cortadas e sobrepostas de forma agressiva, layouts de grid quebrados, micro-interações de hover com distorção, animações de transição bruscas.

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos
