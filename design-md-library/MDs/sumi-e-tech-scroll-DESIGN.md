## Overview

Sumi-e style landing, ink wash painting, rice paper texture, red seal accent, isometric tech details, east asian aesthetic. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Sumi-e didn't arrive in digital design through some trend cycle. It seeped in. The practice — born in Tang Dynasty China, refined into spiritual discipline by Japanese monks — was never about depicting reality. It was about capturing essence in a single, irreversible stroke. No undo button. No layers panel. Just ink, water, and breath.

That philosophy translates to interfaces more honestly than most designers admit. The controlled imperfection of a brush loaded with varying ink density maps directly to how we think about visual weight and hierarchy. A thick downstroke commands attention the way a bold headline does. A trailing whisper of dry brush creates the same tension as generous whitespace around a call to action. The relationship between mark and void — that's layout theory distilled to its oldest form.

What makes sumi-e genuinely useful as a design reference isn't the aesthetic (though it's gorgeous). It's the underlying constraint: say more with less. Ma — the Japanese concept of negative space as active, breathing presence — predates every minimalism manifesto by centuries. Empty space isn't absence. It's architecture.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Rice paper texture background
- Do Ink wash (sumi-e) visual elements
- Do Red stamp/seal accents
- Do Isometric/Tech overlays on traditional art
- Do Brush stroke borders
