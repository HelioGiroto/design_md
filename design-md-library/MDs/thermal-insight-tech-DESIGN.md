## Overview

Thermal imaging landing page, heat map aesthetic, infrared colors, dark tech background, spectrum gradient, technical analysis. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Thermal imaging didn't start as a design language. It started as military surveillance — cold war paranoia rendered in phosphor green. The infrared spectrum was classified territory before it became a palette. What changed everything was accessibility. Once FLIR sensors dropped below five figures, suddenly every building inspector, firefighter, and wildlife researcher had a heat map in their pocket. The aesthetic followed the tooling.

What makes thermal visualization fascinating from a design perspective is its inherent abstraction. You're mapping invisible radiation to visible color. That translation is entirely arbitrary — the classic rainbow gradient from blue-cold to red-hot is a convention, not a truth. Some of the most effective thermal interfaces abandon it completely, opting for monochrome iron palettes or high-contrast white-hot schemes that prioritize readability over spectacle.

The current generation of thermal UI draws from scientific imaging but speaks the language of dashboards. Real-time overlays, threshold alerts, temporal heatmaps showing change over hours. It's data visualization at its most literal — making the invisible visible, then making that visibility actionable.

- Density: 5/10 — Balanced
- Variance: 4/10 — Moderate
- Motion: 4/10 — Subtle

- **Style:** Analytical, Authoritative, Industrial
- **Keywords:** thermal, heat map, infrared, tech, spectrum, gradient, dark, analysis
- **Era:** Future Industrial
- **Light/Dark:** ✗ No / ✓ Full

## Colors

- **Background** (#050B26) — Primary background surface
- **Text** (#FFFFFF) — Primary text color
- **Accent** (#FFC800) — Primary accent, CTAs and interactive elements
- **Hot Red** (#FF0000) — Error states, destructive actions
- **Cool Blue** (#0000FF) — Secondary accent
- **Mid Green** (#00FF00) — Success states, positive indicators


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** Share Tech Mono — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** Share Tech Mono — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** Share Tech Mono — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** Share Tech Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Thermal heat map spectrums (blue to red), technical HUD overlays, wireframe crosshairs, emissive bio-luminescent glow.

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure white (#FFFFFF) backgrounds — use off-white or dark surfaces
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Dark Navy background
- Do Thermal color spectrum (Blue->Green->Red)
- Do HUD/Crosshair overlays
- Do 'Glow' effects on hotspots
- Do Monospace technical text


## Use Case

Landing pages, Modern websites
