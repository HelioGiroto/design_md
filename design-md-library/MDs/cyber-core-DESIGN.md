## Overview

Cyber core landing page with neon-lit, high-speed digital aesthetics. Ideal for marcas de gaming, design de pôsteres, branding digital edgy, portfólios tech. AI-ready template. Cyber Core didn't emerge from design studios — it crawled out of late-90s hacker culture, IRC channels, and the visual language of early intrusion detection systems. The aesthetic owes everything to films like Hackers (1995) and The Matrix (1999), but its real DNA lives in the interfaces nobody was supposed to see: packet sniffers, hex editors, terminal emulators with phosphor burn. Neon on black wasn't a style choice — it was a constraint of CRT monitors running at 2AM.

The revival we're seeing now is driven by cybersecurity's mainstream moment. Every breach headline, every ransomware attack, every CTF competition reinforces the visual vocabulary. Circuit board traces became ornamental. Matrix rain became shorthand for 'digital.' But the best Cyber Core work remembers that the original aesthetic was functional — high contrast for readability, monospace for alignment, color-coding for threat levels. The style works because it was never decorative to begin with.
