## Overview

Modern gothic landing page. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Modern gothic design has nothing to do with haunted houses. Let's get that out of the way. It descends from a lineage that runs through Bauhaus severity, post-punk album art, and the razor-sharp tailoring of Japanese avant-garde fashion. Rick Owens didn't invent darkness — he gave it architecture. Comme des Garçons gave it asymmetry. The movement treats black not as absence but as material, something with weight and texture and temperature.

The fashion-music crossover is where this language solidified. Album packaging for bands like Bauhaus and Siouxsie, the typography of Factory Records, the brutalist stage design of industrial acts — these weren't aesthetic choices, they were philosophical ones. Restraint as rebellion. Elegance as aggression.

This is categorically different from "dark mode." Dark mode is a preference toggle. Modern gothic is a worldview. Where dark mode reduces contrast to ease eye strain, gothic design weaponizes contrast. It uses negative space like silence in music — not empty, but loaded. The palette isn't just dark; it's considered. Charcoal against obsidian. Bone white as punctuation. Every element earns its presence or gets cut.
