## Overview

High-contrast tech interface with strict 60/30/10 color distribution. Ideal for ux/ui de produto digital, dashboards analytics, saas platforms, conteúdo tecnológico, apps b2b. AI-ready template. High-contrast interfaces didn't emerge from aesthetic preference — they emerged from necessity. Early terminal displays were high-contrast by default: phosphor green on black, amber on void. There was no design decision there, just physics. When GUIs arrived and everyone rushed toward light themes and soft gradients, the developers kept their dark terminals. They knew something the design world would take decades to rediscover: contrast isn't decoration, it's information density.

The resurgence started around 2015-2018 when tools like VS Code, Figma, and Linear normalized dark-first interfaces for professional software. These weren't "dark modes" bolted onto light designs — they were conceived in darkness. The philosophy shifted: instead of asking users to opt into dark mode, you designed for the void first and treated light as the accommodation. This inversion changed everything about how we think about hierarchy, because when your canvas is already at zero luminance, every pixel of light becomes intentional. You earn attention through precision, not volume.

## Elevation & Depth

10%: Cyan Neon #00CEC9 para botões primários, notificações e elementos interativos; brilho controlado, bordas técnicas e transições rápidas (180-220ms)

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 24px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Base dark #1E272E predominante (60%)
- Do Leitura forte com #F5F6FA
