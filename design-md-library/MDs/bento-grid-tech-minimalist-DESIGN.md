## Overview

Bento grid landing page, apple style aesthetic, modular layout, rounded cards, clean minimalist tech, organized grid system. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Apple made bento grids famous with those splashy keynote slides — big rounded cards, candy gradients, product shots floating in space. Beautiful stuff. But somewhere around 2021, a quieter mutation emerged. Linear shipped their landing page with bento cards that felt more like terminal windows than marketing material. Dark backgrounds, monospace type, subtle borders that barely whispered. Vercel followed. Then Raycast. The pattern crystallized into something distinctly developer-facing.

This tech-minimalist variant strips the bento grid down to its structural bones. Where Apple uses the format to dazzle, dev-tool companies use it to organize. The cards become containers for code snippets, API response previews, architecture diagrams. Color is functional, not decorative — maybe a single accent against near-black surfaces. The grid itself does the talking.

What's interesting is how this restraint actually increases information density. You can pack more into a bento layout when you're not competing with gradients and blur effects. Companies like Planetscale, Railway, and Resend understood this early. The grid becomes documentation that happens to look good, rather than marketing that happens to contain information.

- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Grid-based (Bento) layout
- Do Large rounded corners (20px+)
- Do Card based content organization
- Do Clean typography (San Francisco/Inter)
- Do Minimalist icons
