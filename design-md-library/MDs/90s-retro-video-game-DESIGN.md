## Overview

90s/Y2K retro video game style landing page. Ideal for games indie, projetos nostálgicos, marketing y2k, streaming, comunidades gamer. AI-ready template. The 90s video game aesthetic wasn't designed to be nostalgic — it was the bleeding edge. When Sega and Nintendo were locked in their console war, every pixel was a deliberate choice made under brutal technical constraints. The SNES could push 256 colors on screen from a palette of 32,768. The Genesis had a smaller palette but faster processing. These limitations forced artists to become masters of suggestion — a four-frame walk cycle that somehow conveyed personality, backgrounds built from repeating 8x8 tiles that still felt like living worlds.

What we now call '16-bit style' was really a collision of Japanese illustration traditions, American comic book energy, and the raw problem-solving of artists working within 64KB of VRAM. The typography was chunky and unapologetic — built for CRT scanlines and living room distances. Color palettes ran hot: saturated blues, electric greens, that specific shade of purple that only existed in Sonic box art.

The Y2K crossover period (roughly 1996-2001) added a layer of early 3D experimentation, metallic gradients, and that unmistakable 'future that never happened' optimism. This era's design language sits at the intersection of pixel craft and the first wave of digital maximalism.

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components
