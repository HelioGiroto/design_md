## Overview

Coral — Cream and coral on near-black, set in oversized Bebas Neue. Bebas Neue typography. near-black canvas, warm cream paper for content, and a saturated coral accent th. Best for fashion / beauty pitch, fitness brand, F&B brand deck. AI-ready design system. Coral as a design accent has roots in the Memphis Group's rejection of modernist restraint — those Italian radicals in the 1980s who decided beige was a moral failing. But the specific pairing of coral against near-black canvas owes more to the editorial tradition of contrast-driven hierarchy. Think Brodovitch at Harper's Bazaar, where a single warm tone against darkness created immediate visual authority.

Bebas Neue enters this lineage as the democratic condensed sans-serif — born from Ryoichi Tsunekawa's 2010 release, it became the typeface that proved you don't need a Grilli Type license to achieve editorial punch. Its tall, narrow letterforms demand vertical space and reward generous leading. When set large against a #1a1a1a canvas with coral (#FF6F61 or thereabouts) as the sole chromatic relief, you get something that feels like a magazine cover without the magazine's budget.

This combination works because it respects a fundamental truth: constraint produces elegance. One typeface, one accent, one dark ground. Everything else is hierarchy and whitespace.
