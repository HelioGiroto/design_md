## Overview

Landing page inspired by acanthus leaf patterns from Greek and Roman architecture. Ideal for detalhes arquitetônicos, tipografia sofisticada, layouts de impressão elegantes, museums. AI-ready template. The acanthus leaf is arguably the most consequential decorative motif in Western design history. It first appeared on the Corinthian capital around 450 BCE — legend credits the sculptor Callimachus, who supposedly spotted acanthus leaves growing around a basket on a young girl's grave. Whether apocryphal or not, the story captures something true: this ornament was born from observing nature under emotional circumstances, not from pure geometric abstraction.

What makes acanthus remarkable is its survivability across millennia of stylistic upheaval. Roman architects scaled it up for imperial propaganda. Byzantine craftsmen flattened it into mosaic borders. Renaissance designers rediscovered it through Vitruvius and made it central to the vocabulary of humanist architecture. The Baroque stretched and curled it into near-unrecognizable exuberance. Even Art Nouveau — ostensibly a rejection of classicism — owes its whiplash curves to the same organic logic that drives acanthus scrollwork.

The motif endures because it solves a fundamental design problem: how to transition between structural geometry and organic beauty. A column is rigid; an acanthus capital softens that rigidity without undermining it. That tension between discipline and flourish is why it still works.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Acanthus leaf SVG border ornaments
- Do Classical column section dividers
- Do Parchment/stone texture backgrounds
- Do Serif typography with flourishes
