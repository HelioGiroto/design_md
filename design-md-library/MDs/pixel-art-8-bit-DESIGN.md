## Overview

Pixel art 8-bit landing page with retro gaming aesthetics. Ideal for jogos indie, marketing retro, designs nostálgicos, portfólios de desenvolvedores de games. AI-ready template. Pixel art wasn't an aesthetic choice — it was a hardware constraint. When the NES shipped with a 256×240 resolution and a 54-color palette, artists had no option but to make every single pixel count. That limitation bred a visual language so potent it outlived the technology that created it. Shigeru Miyamoto's team at Nintendo didn't think in pixels; they thought in readable silhouettes at thumbnail scale. Every sprite was a masterclass in economy.

The 8-bit revival that started in the mid-2000s indie scene wasn't mere nostalgia — it was a rejection of the uncanny valley chase that AAA studios were losing. Games like Shovel Knight and Celeste proved that deliberate pixel work could carry emotional weight that photorealism struggles to match. The constraint became the point.

Today pixel art sits at a fascinating crossroads: it's simultaneously a historical artifact, a living craft, and a shorthand for authenticity in a world drowning in AI-generated smoothness. Designers reach for it when they want to signal that every detail was placed with intention.

## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** Press Start 2P — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** Press Start 2P — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** Press Start 2P — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Asymmetric composition.
- **Feature sections:** Asymmetric grid with varied card sizes. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

image-rendering: pixelated, sharp pixel borders (no anti-aliasing), blocky box-shadows (4px steps), step-based animations (steps()), monospace pixel fonts, CRT scanline overlay effect

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 0px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Sharp edges (0px) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Sharp edges (0px) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do image-rendering: pixelated applied
- Do Limited color palette (8-16 colors)
- Do Pixel font (Press Start 2P)
- Do No border-radius anywhere
- Do Step-based animations only
- Do CRT scanline overlay
- Do Blocky shadows (4px steps)
