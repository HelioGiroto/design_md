## Overview

Playful, modern, friendly landing page with split pastel background. Ideal for apps criativos, plataformas de design, startups friendly, ecommerce lifestyle. AI-ready template. The split background isn't some trendy invention — it's a direct descendant of color field painting. Rothko and Barnett Newman were obsessing over how two adjacent color planes create tension and emotional weight decades before any of us touched a screen. The technique migrated into editorial print design in the 1960s, where art directors at Vogue and Harper's Bazaar used bisected color planes to create visual hierarchy without relying on imagery alone.

The pastel variant — specifically the peach-lavender pairing — gained serious traction in the mid-2010s when Pantone crowned Rose Quartz and Serenity as dual Colors of the Year in 2016. That wasn't arbitrary. It reflected a cultural shift toward gender fluidity and softness in branding that fashion and beauty houses were already exploring. Glossier's visual identity, Mansur Gavriel's campaigns, and countless indie beauty brands adopted these split pastels not as decoration, but as positioning. The two-tone split says: we're refined, we're intentional, we reject the maximalist noise.

Today the pattern persists because it solves a real layout problem — it divides content zones with color alone, eliminating the need for heavy borders or containers while maintaining an unmistakably editorial feel.
