## Overview

3x3 grid-based landing page where content is organized in nine uniform boxes. Ideal for feeds de instagram, moodboards, portfólios, design de vestuário/boutiques. AI-ready template. The 3x3 grid is one of those layouts that feels inevitable — like someone discovered it rather than invented it. Its roots trace back to the Rule of Thirds in classical painting and photography, where dividing a canvas into nine equal zones created natural focal points. But in graphic design, the nine-box grid became a workhorse of Swiss modernism. Müller-Brockmann and his contemporaries used modular grids obsessively, and the 3x3 was the simplest expression of that philosophy: enough cells to create rhythm, few enough to maintain clarity.

What makes it endure in digital design isn't nostalgia — it's math. Nine is the sweet spot where content density meets scannability. Two columns feel sparse, four feel like a spreadsheet. Three columns, three rows: the eye knows exactly where to go. The grid imposes democracy on content — every box gets equal weight, equal breathing room. No hierarchy games, no visual shouting. Just nine honest containers doing their job.

The web didn't invent this layout, but CSS Grid finally made it trivial to implement properly. Before that, we were faking it with floats and clearfixes — a crime against semantics that lasted a decade too long.

## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Strict 3x3 CSS grid layout, uniform gap spacing (16px), subtle hover scale (1.02) on grid items, clean thin borders between cells, smooth fade-in on scroll for each cell, minimal shadow on hover

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Rounded (8px) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Rounded (8px) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Strict 3x3 grid layout
- Do Uniform gap spacing
- Do Clean thin borders between cells
- Do Subtle hover scale effect
- Do Each cell with dedicated content
- Do Single accent color
