## Overview

Modern minimalist landing page with strict 60/30/10 color balance. Ideal for design de logos minimalistas, landing pages corporativas, sites institucionais clean, produtos saas premium. AI-ready template. Modern Minimalism didn't emerge from nowhere — it's the direct descendant of the Swiss International Typographic Style that dominated Zurich and Basel in the 1950s. Josef Müller-Brockmann, Max Bill, and their contemporaries stripped design down to mathematical grids, objective typography, and ruthless clarity. They believed design should inform, not decorate. That conviction aged remarkably well.

The digital translation happened gradually. Early web design couldn't resist ornament — gradients, bevels, textures everywhere. It took Apple's iOS 7 flat redesign in 2013 and Google's Material simplification to prove that restraint scales. Suddenly every SaaS product wanted to look like it was designed in Helvetica on a white canvas. Most failed because they confused emptiness with minimalism.

Real minimalism is expensive. Every element earns its place through function. White space isn't absence — it's active composition. The best contemporary practitioners (Linear, Stripe, Vercel) understand this: they use space as a structural material, not leftover canvas. Typography does the heavy lifting. Color becomes punctuation, not wallpaper. The result feels inevitable, like nothing could be added or removed.
