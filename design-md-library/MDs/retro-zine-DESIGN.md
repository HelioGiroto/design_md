## Overview

Retro Zine — Beige paper with green accent and Bebas Neue + Caveat: a riso-printed zine in HTML form. Bebas Neue typography. warm beige / khaki paper with one saturated forest green. Best for indie zine / publication, music or arts brand, creator portfolio. AI-ready design system. Risograph printing wasn't supposed to become an aesthetic. It was a Japanese office duplicator from the 1980s — Riso Kagaku's answer to expensive offset runs. Churches printed bulletins on it. Schools cranked out worksheets. The machine was fast, cheap, and imperfect in ways nobody cared about because the output was disposable.

Then zine makers got their hands on it. By the mid-2000s, independent publishers realized that the soy-based inks, the slight misregistration between color passes, the grain of the drum — all of it produced something that felt alive in a way laser printers never could. The limitations became the language. Beige uncoated stock wasn't a budget compromise anymore; it was a deliberate canvas that let spot colors sing differently than they would on bright white.

The green accent specifically traces back to the fluorescent ink cartridges Riso offered — colors you literally cannot reproduce in CMYK. That constraint bred a whole visual culture: limited palettes, overprint surprises, happy accidents elevated to design decisions. It's print culture's answer to lo-fi music production.
