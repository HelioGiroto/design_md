## Overview

Fresh, minimal, and luminous UI inspired by Scandinavian design. Ideal for saas moderno, fintechs, apps de produtividade, startups de tecnologia, plataformas de saúde digital. AI-ready template. The pairing of icy blue and forsythia yellow isn't decorative coincidence — it's rooted in the Nordic tradition of designing against darkness. Scandinavian modernists understood that when daylight is scarce for half the year, you engineer luminosity into surfaces. The yellow isn't warm; it's electric, the way forsythia blooms hit against late-March snow. That tension — frozen ground, defiant color — became a visual shorthand for renewal in Nordic graphic design from the 1960s onward.

This palette gained commercial traction through Scandinavian cosmetics and fresh-goods packaging in the 1990s, where brands needed to signal purity without sterility. Pure white felt clinical. But white cut with glacial blue and punctuated by botanical yellow? That read as alive. Clean but not dead. The combination works because it borrows from observable nature rather than from trend forecasting — it's what spring actually looks like at 60° latitude.

Arctic Forsythia codifies that specific moment: the forty-eight hours when ice recedes and the first yellow appears. It's not pastel spring. It's sharp, bright, and unapologetically cold.
