## Overview

Bold Poster — Editorial poster aesthetic with massive Shrikhand display and a single fire-engine red accent. Shrikhand typography. white and warm-cream paper with deep almost-black ink, lifted by a single satura. Best for brand manifesto, creative-led pitch, magazine / editorial. AI-ready design system. The oversized poster tradition owes everything to the reckless confidence of 1960s Swiss Punk and the Italian manifesti that plastered cinema walls with type so large you could read it from a moving Vespa. Shrikhand — a typeface born from Gujarati calligraphic traditions — carries that same unapologetic weight. Its thick strokes and high contrast weren't designed for body copy; they were designed to stop traffic.

Fire-engine red as a background choice isn't decorative. It's confrontational. The combination references Constructivist propaganda posters, punk zine covers, and the raw energy of letterpress broadsides where ink pooled heavy in the counters. When you pair that red with display type scaled beyond reason, you're not designing a layout — you're engineering a physical reaction. The viewer doesn't read it. They feel it hit them.

This template exists in the lineage of designers who understood that restraint is a choice, not a default. Sometimes the brief demands volume.
