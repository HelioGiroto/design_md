## Overview

Neoclassical landing page inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art. Ideal for marcas de luxo, interior design, art galleries, projetos formais e institucionais. AI-ready template. Neoclassical art emerged in the mid-18th century as a direct rebellion against the excess of Rococo. Architects, painters, and sculptors looked back to ancient Greece and Rome—not out of nostalgia, but out of intellectual conviction. The excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum gave artists primary sources they'd never had before. Winckelmann wrote that Greek art achieved "noble simplicity and quiet grandeur," and an entire generation took that as gospel. David, Canova, Ingres—they weren't decorating. They were making moral arguments in marble and oil.

What makes Neoclassical relevant to design today isn't the columns or the togas. It's the underlying philosophy: that restraint communicates authority, that symmetry creates trust, that referencing shared cultural memory gives your work weight it couldn't earn on its own. Every courthouse with a pediment, every university seal with a laurel wreath—that's Neoclassical thinking still doing its job two centuries later.

The style carries an implicit promise: we are serious, we are permanent, we will outlast trends. That's not a small thing to communicate visually.
