## Overview

Playful — Sun-warm peach background with Syne display: a friendly indie launch deck. Syne typography. warm peach / sand backgrounds with ink-black structure and lighter cream cards. Best for creator portfolio, indie product launch, lifestyle brand. AI-ready design system. Flat design killed skeuomorphism, but it also killed warmth. The first wave of flat UI was cold — stark whites, thin grays, surgical precision. It took years for designers to realize you could be flat without being sterile. Somewhere around 2019, indie makers started pushing back. They brought color back — not the neon gradients of startup culture, but softer tones. Peach. Cream. Muted coral. The kind of palette you'd find in a Wes Anderson set, not a Silicon Valley pitch deck.

Syne landed as a typeface that refused to behave like a system font. Its quirky geometry gave headlines personality without resorting to hand-lettered chaos. Paired with generous border-radius and soft shadows (or none at all), it became the backbone of a visual language that said: we're a real product, built by real people, and we don't take ourselves too seriously.

This aesthetic owes as much to zine culture and Japanese stationery design as it does to any UI framework. It's design that feels handpicked, not generated. Intentionally imperfect. Deliberately cozy.
