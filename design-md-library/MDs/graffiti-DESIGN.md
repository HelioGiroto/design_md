## Overview

Graffiti-inspired landing page with bright spray-paint colors on gritty urban backgrounds. Ideal for campanhas de marcas provocadoras, pôsteres de música, linhas de streetwear, eventos urbanos. AI-ready template. Graffiti didn't ask for permission. It emerged from the subway tunnels and freight yards of 1970s New York — writers like TAKI 183, Phase 2, and Dondi tagging their names across a city that refused to see them. It was territorial, political, and deeply personal. The wildstyle lettering that evolved wasn't decoration; it was encryption. Messages meant for those who knew how to read them.

By the 1980s, graffiti collided with gallery culture through figures like Basquiat and Keith Haring, but the tension never resolved. The street version stayed raw — dripping fills, cracked caps, paint running down concrete. That imperfection is the point. Every surface tells you about the hand that made it, the weather that day, the urgency of the moment.

Today graffiti's visual language has been absorbed into everything from typeface design to motion graphics. But the best applications remember where it came from: unauthorized, loud, and impossible to ignore. The grit isn't a filter you apply — it's the DNA of the form.
