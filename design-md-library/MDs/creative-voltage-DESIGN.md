## Overview

Bold, creative, energetic landing page with retro-modern vibes. Ideal for creative agencies, estúdios de música, marcas jovens, eventos culturais. AI-ready template. Electric blue paired with neon yellow didn't emerge from careful color theory workshops. It came from rave flyers, from early-2000s sneaker culture, from the moment designers decided legibility was less important than attitude. The combination screams before it speaks.

By 2015, every creative agency worth its retainer had some version of this palette on their homepage. Split panels — dark left, bright right — became the visual equivalent of a firm handshake. The formula worked because it communicated exactly one thing: we are not boring. Pentagram wouldn't touch it. That was the point.

What's interesting is how the pairing survived the minimalism purge. While other high-energy combinations got flattened into pastels, electric blue and neon yellow kept showing up in pitch decks, hackathon branding, and startup launch pages. The colors carry an implicit promise of velocity — of things being built fast, shipped loud, iterated on publicly. They're the visual language of teams that want you to know they move.
