## Overview

Luxury typography-focused landing page where type IS the design. Ideal for moda haute couture, embalagens premium, streetwear de luxo, capas de revistas. AI-ready template. Luxury typography didn't emerge from design schools — it came from engravers, punchcutters, and the private presses of aristocratic patrons. The Didones of Bodoni and Firmin Didot weren't exercises in geometry; they were status symbols cast in metal, their hairline strokes impossible to reproduce on anything less than the finest paper with the most precise presses. That extreme contrast — thick verticals dissolving into impossibly thin horizontals — was a deliberate flex of craft and capital.

Calligraphic scripts followed a parallel aristocratic lineage. Copperplate hands like Snell Roundhand descended from the writing masters of 17th-century merchant courts, where the quality of your penmanship literally determined your social standing. The pointed nib created swells and tapers that no broad-edge tool could achieve — organic, gestural, unmistakably human.

Today's luxury typographic landscape sits at a tension point. The heritage houses still lean on Didot and Garamond, but a new wave treats restraint itself as the luxury signal — think Céline's shift to a clean sans, or Bottega Veneta's typographic minimalism. The real skill is knowing which register to pull: historical opulence or contemporary austerity. Both whisper money. They just speak different dialects.
