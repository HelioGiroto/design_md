## Overview

Ghibli style landing page, watercolor background, narrative map, whimsical design, soft colors, hand painted look, nature inspired. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Studio Ghibli didn't just make films — they rewired how an entire generation thinks about visual storytelling. Miyazaki's backgrounds, painted by artists like Kazuo Oga, proved that hand-rendered environments could carry emotional weight no CGI pipeline ever matched. That warmth bled into digital design slowly, then all at once. Watercolor textures started appearing in children's apps around 2015, but the real shift was philosophical: designers realized that imperfection communicates care.

The narrative map as interface pattern owes everything to this lineage. Instead of sterile navigation grids, you get a living world — paths that wind, landmarks that breathe, fog rolling over unexplored territory. It's wayfinding through wonder. The user doesn't click a menu; they explore a place.

What makes Ghibli's influence so persistent is restraint. These aren't maximalist illustrations drowning in detail. They're compositions where negative space does half the work, where a single brushstroke suggests an entire forest canopy. That economy translates beautifully to screen — legible at small sizes, emotionally resonant at any scale.

- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Watercolor texture/background
