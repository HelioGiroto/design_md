## Overview

70s landing page, psychedelic style, flower power, groovy font, wavy lines, bright retro colors, hippie aesthetic. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. The 60s gave us acid-drenched visuals — warped letterforms, optical illusions, electric color on black. Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson made posters you had to squint at. Deliberately illegible. Deliberately confrontational. By the early 70s, that aggression softened. The counterculture had won enough battles to relax.

Flower power aesthetics traded the 60s' visual violence for something rounder, warmer, more decorative. Daisies replaced fractals. Earth tones crept in alongside the expected oranges and magentas. Typography went from melting to blooming — fat, bubbly letterforms inspired by Art Nouveau rather than Op Art. The palette shifted from neon-on-black to saturated warmth: burnt orange, avocado, mustard, deep purple against cream or tan.

This wasn't dilution — it was domestication. Psychedelia moved from head shops to department stores, from concert posters to wallpaper. The visual language became accessible, reproducible, commercial. And honestly? That's what makes it useful now. The 70s version already solved the problem of making counterculture aesthetics function at scale.
