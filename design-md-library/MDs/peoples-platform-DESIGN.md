## Overview

People's Platform (Block & Bold) — Activist poster energy: blue, orange, red on cream, with Alfa Slab + Caveat Brush. Alfa Slab One typography. saturated political-poster palette: cobalt blue, signal orange, warning red, on . Best for cultural commentary, manifesto, community / civic deck. AI-ready design system. The activist poster tradition didn't emerge from design schools — it came from urgency. From the Atelier Populaire screenprints of May '68 to ACT UP's silence=death triangle, the most powerful political graphics were made by people who needed to be heard yesterday. Bold slab serifs weren't chosen for aesthetic reasons; they were chosen because they could be read from across a street, stenciled onto a wall, or photocopied a hundred times without losing legibility.

This pairing — Alfa Slab One's unapologetic weight against Caveat's raw handwritten energy — captures that duality perfectly. The slab says institution, authority, demand. The handwriting says human, personal, urgent. Together they recreate the visual language of movements that understood something most brands never will: typography is a political act. Every zine cover, every wheat-pasted broadsheet, every hand-lettered banner at a march carries this DNA.

The block-and-bold approach isn't decorative. It's functional dissent. It exists because marginalized voices learned that whispered messages get ignored, and that the combination of structural boldness with human imperfection is what makes people stop, read, and act.
