## Overview

Scatterbrain — Post-it inspired: pastel sticky notes, Caveat handwriting, Shrikhand and Zilla Slab type stack. Shrikhand typography. off-white paper with a full pastel sticky-note palette (yellow, blue, pink, gree. Best for brainstorm / workshop, creative agency credentials, design-thinking session. AI-ready design system. The sticky note is one of design's happiest accidents. Spencer Silver's failed superglue became Art Fry's bookmark, and by the mid-1980s every brainstorm wall in every agency looked like a Mondrian made of pastel squares. The physical act of scribbling on a Post-it — fast, impermanent, deliberately rough — gave teams permission to think badly before thinking well. Ideas didn't need to be precious when they cost three cents and could be crumpled in a fist.

Digital tools spent years trying to replicate that energy and mostly failed. Miro boards and FigJam canvases feel clinical — too aligned, too pixel-perfect. What makes a real brainstorm wall work is the chaos: cards at odd angles, overlapping edges, handwriting that ranges from legible to hieroglyphic. Scatterbrain leans into that disorder on purpose.

The Caveat typeface is the linchpin here. Its wobbly baseline and uneven letter spacing read as human thought captured mid-flight, not a font pretending to be handwriting. Pair it with slight card rotations — two to five degrees, never uniform — and you get a layout that feels like someone actually used it, not just designed it.

## Elevation & Depth

display font Shrikhand for hero headlines, playful hover animations (scale 1.03, 200ms), bouncy click states, rotated post-it cards (±3–6deg), Caveat handwriting, pastel sticky-note palette, dense grid, compact 1.2rem gaps

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 4px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** 4px border-radius. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** 4px corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.

- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Shrikhand display font loaded via Google Fonts
- Do Color palette variables applied consistently
- Do Typography scale: hero clamp(2.5rem,5vw,4rem)
- Do H1 2.25rem
