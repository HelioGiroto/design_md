## Overview

Nostalgic and playful retro landing page for a 90s-style digital marketing agency. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Before algorithms decided what you'd see, the internet was a mess — and it was glorious. GeoCities pages stacked animated GIFs on tiled backgrounds, visitor counters ticked upward like badges of honor, and "Under Construction" signs were everywhere because everything genuinely was. The early web had no gatekeepers. A twelve-year-old's Sailor Moon fansite sat next to a PhD's research page, both equally ugly, both equally valid. Marquee text scrolled endlessly. Frames broke navigation. It was chaos with a blinking cursor.

That rawness is exactly what makes 90s digital aesthetics resonate now. For millennials, these visuals aren't just retro — they're emotional shorthand for a time when the internet felt like discovery, not consumption. The pixelated edges, the system fonts, the garish color clashes — they represent optimism about technology before tech became surveillance.

Designers started pulling these elements back around 2018, first ironically, then sincerely. What began as vaporwave moodboards evolved into legitimate brand identities. The aesthetic works because it signals authenticity in an era of polished sameness. It says: we remember when things were weird, and we liked it better that way.

## Elevation & Depth

Elementos de UI de sistemas operacionais antigos (janelas, botões 3D), tipografia pixelizada e "web-safe", fundos com padrões geométricos e texturas de "ruído", bordas com efeito de "bisel", micro-interações de clique com som de "dial-up", animações de transição de tela com efeito de "varredura" ou "pixelização".

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.
