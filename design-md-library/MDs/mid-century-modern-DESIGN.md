## Overview

Mid-century modern landing page with clean lines, organic curves and muted vibrant colors from the 1950s. Ideal for branding de móveis, layouts de pôsteres retro, decoração de interiores, produtos lifestyle. AI-ready template. Mid-Century Modern emerged between the mid-1940s and late 1960s as a direct rejection of prewar ornamentation. Designers like Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen, and Arne Jacobsen weren't decorating — they were solving problems. New materials (molded plywood, fiberglass, aluminum) enabled forms that previous generations couldn't manufacture. The movement democratized good design; the Eames lounge chair was aspirational, but their molded plywood chairs were meant for everyone.

What makes MCM endure isn't nostalgia — it's the logic. Every curve exists because the material wanted to go there. Every leg is tapered because it's structurally honest. The style spread from furniture to architecture to graphic design because its principles are universal: respect materials, eliminate the unnecessary, let function generate form.

The postwar optimism baked into MCM gives it warmth that pure modernism lacks. It's modernism that actually wants you to sit down and stay awhile.
