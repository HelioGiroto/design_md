## Overview

Pointillism/stipple art landing page where visual texture is created through thousands of tiny dots. Ideal for ilustrações editoriais, embalagens artísticas, marcas com margem artística, pôsteres. AI-ready template. Pointillism emerged in 1886 when Georges Seurat exhibited *A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte* and essentially told the Impressionists they were doing color mixing wrong. Instead of blending pigments on the palette — which dulls chroma — Seurat placed pure dots of color side by side, letting optical mixing happen in the viewer's eye. It was painting as systematic research. Neo-Impressionists like Signac followed, but the technique never became mainstream. It demanded insane patience and a scientific understanding of complementary color theory that most painters simply didn't care to pursue.

Stippling — pointillism's ink-based cousin — found its real home in scientific illustration and engraving. Before halftone printing existed, stipple was how you rendered tonal gradation in single-color reproduction. Botanical illustrators, cartographers, and medical artists built entire visual languages from nothing but dots and patience. The technique survived the digital revolution precisely because no algorithm replicates the deliberate irregularity of hand-placed marks.

Today pointillism lives in premium packaging, editorial illustration, and brand identities that need to signal craft without shouting. It's the opposite of speed — every dot is a decision.

## Colors

- **Warm White** (#FAF8F0) — Light surface, card backgrounds
- **Ink Black** (#1A1A1A) — Dark surface, primary background
- **Stipple Blue** (#2E5090) — Accent highlight, links and focus states
- **Stipple Red** (#C0392B) — Error states, destructive actions
- **Stipple Green** (#27AE60) — Success states, positive indicators
- **Stipple Yellow** (#F1C40F) — Warning states, attention indicators
- **Warm Grey** (#7F8C8D) — Secondary text, borders, muted elements
- **Soft Cream** (#F5F0E0) — Secondary surface


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** Source Serif Pro — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** Source Serif Pro — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** Source Serif Pro — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Asymmetric composition.
- **Feature sections:** Asymmetric grid with varied card sizes. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

CSS radial-gradient dot patterns at various densities, stipple texture overlays, dot-based section dividers, pointillist gradient backgrounds (dots instead of smooth gradients), subtle dot animation on hover, grain/noise texture via SVG filter

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 0px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Sharp edges (0px) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Sharp edges (0px) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Dot pattern textures throughout
- Do Varying dot densities for depth
- Do Stipple-based section dividers
- Do Clean typography contrasting with dots
- Do Pointillist gradient backgrounds
- Do Artistic impressionist atmosphere
- Do Responsive with maintained dot textures


## Use Case

Editorial illustrations, Artistic packaging, Artistically-minded brands, Posters
