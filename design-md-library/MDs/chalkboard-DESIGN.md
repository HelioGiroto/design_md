## Overview

Chalkboard-style landing page. Ideal for education, tutoriais, restaurants, projetos nostálgicos, menus criativos. AI-ready template. Chalkboard lettering is one of the few typographic traditions that never fully migrated to digital — and that's precisely what makes it powerful. Before vinyl signage and LED menus, every café, schoolroom, and butcher shop communicated through chalk on slate. The medium forced economy: you wrote what mattered, erased what didn't, and the impermanence was the point. There's a reason blackboards survived the overhead projector, the whiteboard, and the smartboard in cultural memory.

The craft revival of the 2010s turned chalkboard art into a full discipline — Dana Tanamachi's work for Google and Starbucks proved that hand-drawn chalk could hold its own against any polished brand system. But the aesthetic predates that moment by centuries. Victorian pub signs, French bistro menus, one-room schoolhouses — chalk was the original responsive medium. It adapted to whatever surface and whatever message the day demanded.

What designers often miss: chalkboard isn't nostalgic decoration. It's a signal of impermanence, craft, and human presence. When you deploy it, you're telling people that this message was made by a hand, today, for them.

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.
