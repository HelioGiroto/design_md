## Overview

Raw Grid — Neo-brutalist deck with thick borders, offset shadows, and a pink/sage/ink palette. Segoe UI / system-ui typography. white background with ink-black structure, soft pink and sage green as flat colo. Best for startup pitch, accelerator demo day, founder pitch. AI-ready design system. Brutalism in graphic design didn't emerge from laziness — it was a deliberate rejection of the polished, corporate-sanitized interfaces that dominated the early 2010s. Designers were suffocating under flat design's beige uniformity, and brutalism said: show the structure, expose the grid, stop pretending software is a magazine spread.

The neo-brutalist wave that followed — thick borders, raw grids, offset shadows in confrontational colors — owes as much to zine culture and punk typography as it does to Béton brut architecture. It's the visual language of people who build things in public and refuse to sand down the edges. The pink offset shadow specifically became a signature move around 2019-2021, a way to inject irreverence without losing legibility.

What makes Raw Grid interesting is that it takes the brutalist ethos and gives it just enough system to be usable at scale. It's not chaos cosplay — it's structured rebellion. The grid is visible because the grid IS the design.
