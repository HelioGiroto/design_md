## Overview

Y2K landing page with vibrant neon colors and early 2000s tech optimism. Ideal for editoriais de moda, colagens digitais, campanhas de streetwear, social networks. AI-ready template. Y2K design didn't emerge from a vacuum — it was the visual language of a generation that genuinely believed the future had arrived. Between 1997 and 2003, every surface got the treatment: inflatable chrome typography, translucent plastics lifted straight from iMac G3 casings, and color palettes that looked like someone liquefied a rave flyer. Designers were drunk on optimism and Macromedia Flash.

The aesthetic pulled from multiple streams simultaneously. Japanese street fashion, early internet culture, Britney-era pop maximalism, and the literal Y2K anxiety that made everything feel urgent and temporary. Nothing was subtle because subtlety felt like a waste when the millennium was turning over.

What makes Y2K interesting now isn't nostalgia alone — it's that the original movement was already referencing futures that never happened. We're nostalgic for an imagined tomorrow. That recursive quality gives contemporary Y2K revival its strange depth. It's not retro in the traditional sense. It's speculative fiction wearing lip gloss.
