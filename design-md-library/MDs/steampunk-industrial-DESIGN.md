## Overview

Steampunk industrial interface. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Steampunk didn't start as an aesthetic — it started as a literary argument. When Gibson and Sterling wrote The Difference Engine in 1990, they weren't designing a vibe. They were asking: what if the information age arrived a century early, powered by steam and brass instead of silicon? That question cracked open an entire genre.

The maker movement grabbed it and ran. Suddenly you had people building actual functional computers inside mahogany cases, soldering copper pipe into keyboard frames, retrofitting analog gauges onto digital devices. It wasn't cosplay — it was a philosophical stance. A rejection of the disposable, the sealed-shut, the deliberately opaque. If you can't see the gears, how do you trust the machine?

In UI, steampunk translates surprisingly well. Gauges become progress indicators. Dials become input controls. Riveted panels become card containers. The mechanical metaphor gives users something physical to grab onto — every interaction implies weight, resistance, consequence. Nothing happens without visible cause and effect. That's not decoration. That's information architecture wearing a top hat.

## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** serif/industrial --navy-bg: #0D1B33 — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** serif/industrial --navy-bg: #0D1B33 — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** serif/industrial --navy-bg: #0D1B33 — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Cinematic warm rim lighting, gear rotation animations, steam particle effects, clockwork tick animations, brass shimmer on hover

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Brass gears present
- Do Copper accents visible
- Do Weathered texture
- Do Dark navy background
- Do Clockwork animations
- Do Victorian machinery feel
