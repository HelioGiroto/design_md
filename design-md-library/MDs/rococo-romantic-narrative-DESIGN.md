## Overview

Rococo landing page, romantic style, pastel colors, gold accents, floral decorations, soft and dreamy, ornate luxury. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Rococo never really left. It just went underground — resurfacing in branding that refuses to be minimal, in interfaces that treat ornament as content rather than crime. The movement that gave us Fragonard's stolen glances and Boucher's impossible skies was always about narrative excess: every curl of gilding, every blush of rose, existed to pull you deeper into a story. That impulse translates directly into digital work that prioritizes atmosphere over efficiency.

What makes Rococo relevant now isn't nostalgia — it's the counter-position. After a decade of flat design and geometric austerity, pastel ornament feels genuinely subversive. The palette alone does heavy lifting: dusty lavenders, champagne golds, powder blues that read as both delicate and deliberate. Layer in illustrative flourishes — cartouches, ribbons, botanical frames — and you're building worlds, not wireframes.

The danger, obviously, is kitsch. The difference between Rococo romance and a greeting card is intentionality. Fragonard composed chaos. Every asymmetric swirl had counterweight. Digital Rococo demands the same discipline: ornament must serve narrative, not decorate emptiness.
