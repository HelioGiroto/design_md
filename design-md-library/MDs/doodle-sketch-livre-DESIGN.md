## Overview

Doodle sketch infographic. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Long before Figma or Illustrator, people explained complex ideas with a marker and a napkin. The back-of-envelope sketch has always been the fastest path from confusion to clarity — messy, immediate, human. That tradition never really left; it just went digital.

Excalidraw changed the conversation in 2020. Suddenly a free, open-source tool proved that wobbly lines and imperfect shapes could communicate architecture diagrams, user flows, and data relationships better than polished vector art. tldraw followed with the same conviction: roughness is a feature, not a bug. The aesthetic signals "this is a draft, think with me" — which lowers the stakes and invites collaboration in ways a pixel-perfect chart never could.

Hand-drawn infographics tap into something cognitive. When data looks sketched, viewers slow down. They read instead of glance. The imperfection creates intimacy — it feels like someone sat across from you and drew it out. That's why education platforms, brainstorming tools, and whiteboard apps keep reaching for this style. It makes the complex feel approachable, and the intimidating feel like a conversation.
