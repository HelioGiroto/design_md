## Overview

Bold and provocative neobrutalist landing page for a disruptive design agency. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. When Sahil Lavingia redesigned Gumroad in 2020, he didn't just strip away the polish — he detonated it. Black borders. Saturated primaries. Drop shadows that looked like they were rendered in MS Paint. The internet lost its mind. Designers called it ugly. Then they copied it.

What followed wasn't a trend. It was a permission slip. Suddenly every creative agency landing page, every Web3 project, every portfolio site that wanted to scream "we're not like them" had a formula: 4px borders, one loud color, flat illustrations with intentional roughness. The aesthetic said anti-corporate while being deployed by corporations. That tension is the point.

Bold neobrutalism works because it's legible as rebellion without actually being difficult. It borrows concrete architecture's honesty — exposed structure, no decorative lies — but wraps it in candy colors. It's brutalism for people who still want to convert visitors. The thick-border-primary-color formula became a shorthand for disruption, and unlike most shorthand, it still hits when executed with conviction rather than copied from a Figma community file.
