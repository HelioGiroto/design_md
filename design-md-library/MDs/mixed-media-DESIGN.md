## Overview

Mixed media landing page combining collage, painting and photography aesthetics. Ideal for spreads de revistas, capas de álbuns, publicidade criativa, portfólios artísticos. AI-ready template. Mixed media isn't a style — it's a refusal to pick one. Its roots sit somewhere between Cubist papier collé, Dada photomontage, and the ripped-poster walls of 1960s Paris. Schwitters was gluing bus tickets to canvas before anyone had a word for it. Rauschenberg's Combines blew the door open: painting could hold photographs, fabric, found objects, whatever served the idea. The point was never decoration. It was confrontation — forcing unlike materials into dialogue until something unexpected emerged.

Digitally, mixed media found new legs in the zine explosion of the '90s and the early-web collage aesthetic that treated the screen like a light table. David Carson's Ray Gun layouts proved that layering photography over paint textures over torn paper could communicate feeling faster than clean typography ever would. Today the approach lives in editorial design, album art, fashion campaigns, and any context where polish feels dishonest. The tension between analog texture and digital precision is the whole point — it signals that a human hand was here, making decisions that no grid system would sanction.
