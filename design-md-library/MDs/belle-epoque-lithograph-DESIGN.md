## Overview

Belle epoque landing page, art nouveau style, alphonse mucha aesthetic, lithograph texture, floral borders, vintage elegance, pastel colors. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. The Belle Époque gave us the poster as art object. Before Mucha draped his Byzantine-haired women across Parisian kiosks, before Toulouse-Lautrec flattened the Moulin Rouge into pure graphic punch — advertising was forgettable. Lithography changed that. Suddenly color was cheap, scale was possible, and the street became a gallery. Mucha's genius wasn't just ornament for ornament's sake. Those sinuous borders, the botanical halos, the layered frames — they created hierarchy. They told your eye exactly where to land.

Translated to digital, this vocabulary is absurdly potent for luxury branding. The ornamental frame becomes a container component. The flowing hair becomes a decorative divider. The muted metallics and dusty pastels signal craft without screaming wealth. What works is restraint within excess — every curl has a job.

The frame-as-UI-pattern deserves special attention. In lithographic posters, borders weren't decoration — they were architecture. They separated title from figure from background. Modern card components, modal overlays, even navigation wells can borrow this logic: use ornamental borders not as flair, but as structural rhythm that guides the viewer through content zones.
