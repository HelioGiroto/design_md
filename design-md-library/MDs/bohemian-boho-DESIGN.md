## Overview

Bohemian landing page with vibrant yet muted earthy tones. Ideal for branding de eventos, linhas de moda, produtos lifestyle, marcas de viagem. AI-ready template. Bohemian visual language didn't emerge from a design studio — it crawled out of 19th-century Parisian garrets where artists, writers, and Roma travelers rejected bourgeois aesthetics in favor of layered, imperfect beauty. The term itself comes from French society's assumption that Romani people originated in Bohemia, and the artists who lived like them — broke, nomadic, deliberately unkempt — adopted the label as a badge of honor. William Morris and the Arts & Crafts movement formalized some of these instincts into repeating organic patterns, but boho always resisted full systematization.

The 1960s and 70s counterculture gave it a second life. Moroccan tiles, Indian block prints, Turkish kilims, Guatemalan textiles — all got flattened into a Western aesthetic vocabulary that prioritized feeling over cultural specificity. This is the tension every designer working in boho must navigate: the style's power comes from its eclecticism, but eclecticism without intention is just appropriation with better typography.

Today's boho sits in a more considered place. The best implementations use muted vibrancy — terracotta instead of orange, sage instead of green, dusty rose instead of pink — creating warmth without the visual noise that plagued early-2010s boho Pinterest boards.
