## Overview

Vellum — Deep navy canvas with warm-yellow italic Cormorant serifs and a single dusty teal accent. A quiet, scholarly aesthetic. Cormorant Garamond Italic typography. deep periwinkle navy canvas with warm yellow italic-serif type and one dusty-tea. Best for research findings, white paper or longform report, academic or university deck. AI-ready design system. Vellum was the surface before paper — calfskin stretched and scraped until it became translucent, holding ink with a warmth that wood pulp never replicated. The name matters here because this system is explicitly about that pre-industrial relationship between text and surface, where typography wasn't consumed but inhabited.

Cormorant in italic carries the DNA of Garamond's Renaissance punchcutting, but with a contemporary optical refinement that lets it breathe at display sizes without losing its calligraphic memory. The italic specifically — not the roman — because italic was originally a separate typeface entirely, designed for continuous reading in compact Aldine pocket editions. Choosing italic as the display voice is a deliberate inversion: what was once the economical choice becomes the luxurious one.

Deep navy against warm yellow isn't arbitrary. It's the color relationship of gilt lettering on cloth-bound spines — the palette of a library at dusk, where gold tooling catches the last light against indigo boards. This system doesn't reference books; it references the physical object of the book as a designed artifact.
