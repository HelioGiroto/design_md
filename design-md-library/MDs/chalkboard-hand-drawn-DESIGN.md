## Overview

Chalkboard hand-drawn interface. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. The chalkboard aesthetic didn't start on Pinterest. It started in pubs, in classrooms, on the sidewalk signs of bakeries that couldn't afford printed menus. Hand-drawn lettering carried information before typography was democratized — and it carried personality with it. Every wobbly serif, every smudged edge said: a human was here.

Digital design rediscovered this in the early 2010s. Suddenly every coffee shop website needed a blackboard texture and some faux-chalk script. Most of it was terrible — slapping a grunge overlay on Lobster font isn't craft, it's costume. But the good stuff understood something deeper: imperfection is a trust signal. When everything around you is pixel-perfect and suspiciously polished, a hand-drawn line feels like eye contact.

Now, in a landscape flooded with AI-generated imagery, the chalkboard style hits differently. It's a deliberate rejection of frictionless production. The eraser smudges, the uneven baselines, the dust — they say this wasn't generated in three seconds. Whether that's true or not, the feeling lands. Warmth through visible effort.

## Elevation & Depth

Flat classroom lighting, chalk drawing animations (stroke-dasharray), eraser wipe transitions, hand-drawn wobble, sketch reveal on scroll

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Chalkboard background
- Do Chalk text effect
- Do Hand-drawn elements
- Do Eraser smudges subtle
- Do Educational feel
- Do Sketch icons present
