## Overview

Scrapbook/collage landing page with analog handmade tactile aesthetics. Ideal for diários pessoais, convites de casamento, vision boards, publicações acolhedoras em redes sociais. AI-ready template. The scrapbook is one of the oldest forms of personal visual storytelling. Long before Instagram grids or Pinterest boards, people were cutting, tearing, and taping fragments of their lives onto pages — ticket stubs next to polaroids next to handwritten notes. The practice exploded in Victorian England as a bourgeois hobby, but its real power has always been democratic: anyone with scissors and glue could compose a narrative.

Digitally, the collage aesthetic resurfaces every time culture gets tired of clean minimalism. It showed up in zine culture, in early Tumblr, in Y2K revival graphics, and now in apps that want to signal authenticity over polish. The visual language — overlapping layers, visible tape, rotated photos, sticker accents — communicates that something was made by a human hand, even when it wasn't.

What makes scrapbook UI interesting is the tension between chaos and composition. The best implementations look effortless but are carefully art-directed. Random rotation angles that are actually constrained to a range. Overlaps that follow a z-index hierarchy. Tape strips that anchor without obscuring. It's controlled messiness — and that's genuinely hard to pull off.
