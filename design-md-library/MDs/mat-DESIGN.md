## Overview

Mat — Dark sage canvas with bone paper and burnt-orange accent; mid-century modern with wood undertones. Bricolage Grotesque typography. muted sage green canvas with warm bone paper and a saturated burnt-orange accent. Best for design studio credentials, architecture / interior brand, ceramics or craft brand. AI-ready design system. Mat finishes have roots in Japanese wabi-sabi and Scandinavian craft traditions—surfaces that refuse to perform. The dark sage and bone paper combination draws directly from 1970s back-to-land publishing: think Whole Earth Catalog covers, hand-set type on uncoated stock, ink that sat heavy and uneven. There's a reason artisan ceramicists and natural dyers keep returning to these palettes. They signal process over polish.

The burnt-orange accent isn't decorative—it's functional warmth. Historically it appeared in terracotta glazes, aged leather tooling, and the oxidized edges of copper vessels. It's the color of things that have been touched, used, lived with. When you pair it against sage and bone, you get a palette that feels inherited rather than designed. That's the entire point. Mat rejects the clinical precision of luxury minimalism in favor of something more honest: surfaces you want to run your hand across.
