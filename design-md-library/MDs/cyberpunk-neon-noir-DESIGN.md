## Overview

Cyberpunk landing page, neon noir style, dark background, glowing neon colors, glitch effects, futuristic ui, high contrast. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Cyberpunk Neon Noir isn't just cyberpunk with the saturation cranked up. It's a deliberate collision — the moral ambiguity of 1940s film noir dragged through rain-slicked streets lit by kanji-covered holograms. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner didn't invent this fusion, but it crystallized it. That perpetual rain. Those neon reflections pooling on wet asphalt. Darkness as the default state, punctuated by artificial light that never quite reaches the corners.

Where generic cyberpunk leans into chrome and information overload, Neon Noir strips back. It's reductive. The palette is constrained — deep blacks, electric magentas, cold cyans — and the mood is heavy. Think detective stories told in light pollution. There's loneliness baked into the aesthetic; single figures dwarfed by towering advertisements, faces half-lit by screens nobody's watching.

The genre owes as much to Raymond Chandler as it does to William Gibson. That's the distinction most designers miss. It's not about technology worship — it's about alienation rendered beautiful through contrast. Light against void. Signal against noise.

## Elevation & Depth

Holographic wireframes, brain and gear iconography, hexagonal grid overlays, digital noise, CRT scanlines, luminescent neon emission.

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure white (#FFFFFF) backgrounds — use off-white or dark surfaces
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Dark background (black/blue)
- Do Neon colors (Cyan/Magenta)
- Do Glitch/Scanline effects
- Do Angular/Tech shapes
- Do Glowing text and borders


## Use Case

Landing pages, Modern websites
