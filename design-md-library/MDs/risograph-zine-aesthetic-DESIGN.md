## Overview

Risograph landing page, zine aesthetics, grainy texture, multiply blending mode, retro print style, bright pink and blue ink. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Zines never needed permission. From the punk photocopied pamphlets of the late '70s to the riot grrrl manifestos of the '90s, the zine was always the medium of people who couldn't wait for gatekeepers to let them in. Cheap, fast, imperfect on purpose.

Then risograph entered the picture — or rather, re-entered it. Originally a Japanese office duplicator from the 1980s, the Riso machine found a second life in the 2010s among artists, illustrators, and small publishers who craved that specific look: soy-based inks with a grain you can almost feel through the page, misregistered layers that turn accidents into texture. Studios like Hato Press in London and Perfectly Acceptable in Minneapolis turned the machine into a creative tool, not just a reproduction one.

What makes the risograph revival stick is economics meeting aesthetics. Short runs of 50–500 copies become viable. Each print carries slight variation — no two copies identical. That imperfection became the point. In a world of pixel-perfect screens, riso reminded people that print could breathe.

- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).

## Elevation & Depth

Simulated offset printing, varying opacity layers (multiply effect), coarse paper grain, ink bleed, rough stamp-like stroke edges.

- Minimal motion design. Hover states use color transitions only (150ms).
- No entry animations. No page transitions. Instant, utilitarian feedback.
- Performance: No animation overhead. Static-first approach.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.

- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Off-white/Paper background
- Do Multiply blending modes on colors
- Do Grainy/Noise texture overlay
- Do Misaligned registration effects
