## Overview

Musical elements infographic. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. SoundCloud changed everything. Before 2008, audio on the web was a play button and a progress bar — maybe a spinning disc if you were lucky. Then those orange waveforms appeared, and suddenly you could *see* where the drop hits, where the quiet part lives, where someone left a comment at 2:34. It was metadata made tangible.

Spotify took a different route. Less literal, more atmospheric — color extraction from album art, those behind-the-lyrics animations, the year-wrapped visualizations that turned listening habits into shareable identity. The insight was sharp: people don't just want to hear music, they want to see themselves in it.

The fundamental tension hasn't changed though. Sound is temporal. It exists in time, not space. Every audio visualization is a translation — frequency to height, amplitude to brightness, tempo to motion. The best ones don't try to be accurate representations. They're interpretations. They give you a feeling that matches what your ears already know. The worst ones look like screensavers from 2003.

## Elevation & Depth

Vibrant energetic illumination, sound wave animations, note floating effects, rhythm-based transitions, frequency visualization, beat-synced reveals

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components
